TEXT_MINI = '''In the quiet village of Willow Creek, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, lived an old gardener named Eli. With hands weathered by time and soil, Eli tended to his garden with a love so deep it made the flowers blush and the trees stand a bit taller. One spring morning, as the first rays of sunshine pierced the dewy air, Eli discovered a rare blue rose blooming among the sea of greens and colorsâ€”a rose he had heard of in stories but never believed to exist. This miraculous find became the talk of the village, drawing curious eyes and eager hearts to Eli's garden. But in his wisdom, Eli knew the rose wasn't meant for fame or fortune; it was a reminder from the earth, a symbol of the beauty and mystery that lies in the simplest moments of life. He cared for the blue rose, letting it thrive in its natural home, while continuing his daily rituals, teaching all who visited that the truest treasures are often hidden in plain sight, nurtured by patience and love.'''
