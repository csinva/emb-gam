### Processing MIMIC-IV data

#### Preliminaries
[MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/) (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) is a publicly available dataset that contains de-identified health records of over 400,000 patients who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2008 and 2019. The dataset includes comprehensive clinical data such as vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, procedures, and imaging studies.

The dataset is hosted by the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is available to researchers who meet certain eligibility criteria, including completing a data use agreement and obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval.

In experiments, we used MIMIC-IV-2.2. In addition to downloading the MIMIC dataset, ICD codes 9/10 need to be downloaded as well. ICD codes (International Classification of Diseases) are a standardized system of alphanumeric codes used to classify and identify diseases, injuries, and other medical conditions. They are used by healthcare providers and insurance companies to describe and document patient diagnoses and treatments.
